1a. Student.Major, Course.Course_number, Department.Department_number, Section.Course_number,
  Prerequisite.Course_number, and Prerequisite_number need to change.
  
 1b. We could make a new Department table that has id (1, 2, 3, ...) and name (CSSE, MATH, ...) fields.
  Then we can change Student.Major to Student.MajorID and Course.Department to Course.DepartmentID. We
  can also split all course number fields to course_department_id and course_number.
